Custom segments
===============
The segment accessors are defined in an XML file (hl7segdef.xml) and are auto-generated by a Python script (hl7segdef.py). The code used to access the segments is already included in the project (see the src/seg_*.c and the include/hl7parser/seg_*.h files). If you need to modify the segment definitions, just remove these files, modify the XML file and run the script like this:

python ./hl7segdef.py <file name>
